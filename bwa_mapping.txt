Mapping with bwa
================

One of the most common operations when dealing with NGS data is mapping sequences
to other sequences, and most commonly, mapping reads to a reference. Because
short read alignment is so common, there is a deluge of programs available for doing
it, and it is well-understood problem. Most of the efficient programs work by first
building an *index* of the sequence that will be mapped to, which allows for
extremely fast lookups, and then running a separate module which uses that index
to align short sequences against the reference. Alignment is used for visualization,
coverage estimation, SNP calling, expression analysis, and a slew of other problems.
For a high-level overview, try `this NCBI review <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836519/>`__.

Getting the Dependencies
````````````````````````

bwa is one of the many available read mappers. bwa is a good "reference" version 
of a common alignment algorithm based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform; those
of you looking to dive into a relatively thick paper on it can read about it
`here <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/14/1754.short>`__.

Firstly, let's download bwa::

    cd /root
    curl -L "http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/bio-bwa/bwa-0.7.5a.tar.bz2?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fbio-bwa%2Ffiles%2F&ts=1379347638&use_mirror=softlayer-dal" > bwa-0.7.5a.tar.bz2

And then decompress it::

    tar xjf bwa-0.7.5a.tar.bz2

Now, change into the directory with the source code and compile it::

    cd bwa-0.7.5a/
    make
    
Finally, move the compiled executable to a location where the operating system
can find it::

    cp bwa /usr/local/bin

So what did we actually just do? bwa is offered as an open-source program -- that
is, the actual code which defines its functionality is freely available. However,
bwa is written in C, which, unlike Python, is not "interpreted." Instead, the
source code needs to be parsed and converted into machine language which can be
run on the processor. This allows compiled programs to run much more efficiently 
than their interpreted counterparts, at the cost of needing to be recompiled for
different systems. Although pre-compiled executables can be found for many programs,
Unix programs are often distributed as source. 'make' is a program for tracking
dependencies amongst files, and is used to manage the compilation of larger
projects with many files.

'make' is also very useful for setting up pipelines, as it is not limited to
source files -- it can be used for any situation where one program needs to output
of another to run. You can read about it `here <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`__ if you're interested, though
it's outside the scope of this tutorial.

Getting the Data
````````````````

We'll be using the data we downloaded during the reads and quality control session;
if you missed that, go run through it in :doc:`reads_and_qc`

Mapping the Reads
`````````````````

To speed up the demonstration, we will just map a subset of the reads rather than
the entire file, which is somewhat large (though small compared to many datasets).
The head command outputs the first n lines of a file, by default 4::

    head -n 100000 ecoli_ref-5m.fastq.gz.1 > left.fa
    head -n 100000 ecoli_ref-5m.fastq.gz.2 > right.fa

We've got our reads and a reference, so we're ready to get started. First, we
build an index of the reference genome using bwa::

    bwa index -a bwtsw ecoli_k12.fa 

The -a flag tells bwa which indexing algorithm to use. The program will automatically
output some files with set extensions, which the main alignment program knows the
format of. Thus, we run the alignment like so::

    bwa mem ecoli_k12.fa left.fa right.fa > aln.x.ecoli_k12.sam

which aligns the left and right reads against the reference, and outputs them
to the given SAM file. SAM is a common format for alignments which is understood
by many programs, along with BAM. It's often useful to have both, so we'll use
a utility called samtools to produce a sorted BAM file as well::

    samtools view -uS aln.x.ecoli_k12.sam > aln.x.ecoli_k12.bam
    samtools sort aln.x.ecoli_k12.bam aln.x.ecoli_k12.bam.sorted
    samtools index aln.x.ecoli_k12.bam.sorted.bam

Visualizing your Data with Tablet
`````````````````````````````````

Although you can do many things with your alignments, one useful thing is to simply
view them through a graphical interface. To demonstrate this, we'll use a program
called Tablet, which can be downloaded `here <http://bioinf.scri.ac.uk/tablet/download.shtml>`__.

Tablet claims to run on Windows, Linux, and OSX, though I have only tested it out
on Linux. Because this is a GUI-driven program, we'll be running it on our
local machines instead of our EC2 instances. So, go ahead and grab the approriate
version for your system, and install it.

Once you have it installed, open it up.
